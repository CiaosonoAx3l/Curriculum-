        <h2>My Biography</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Alessandro Mercede</strong>.</p>

        <p>Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by technology and enjoyed taking computers apart to see how each component worked piece by piece. As I grew up, this curiosity turned into a real passion. I was intrigued by how such a small object like a smartphone could hold so much information, and as a child, I almost perceived it as magic.</p>

        <p>At the same time, I became interested in video games, starting with PlayStation consoles, then moving on to handheld consoles, and finally PC gaming. After middle school, I already knew I wanted to deepen everything related to technology, so I decided to enroll at the Galileo Galilei Institute, majoring in Computer Science and Telecommunications. Even though it was in another city from where I lived, I wanted to challenge myself.</p>

        <p>Attending that school, I was somewhat disappointed by the teaching, often too superficial, but I became particularly passionate about one subject: biology. This passion has stayed with me over time, even though I later focused more on computer science. In the future, however, I would like to combine these two passions in the field of bioinformatics.</p>

        <p>At the age of 16, I moved to Vicenza, leaving friends and family, to explore new horizons. I attended the third year of high school at a stricter school, where the teachers were much more demanding. The first year was a real challenge: despite my effort, passing seemed impossible, and some teachers even advised me to change schools. I never gave up.</p>

        <p>During that time, I decided to buy a workstation, because I thought I could be more productive. Studying online, I discovered that pre-built PCs were very expensive without real justification. There was only one solution... I decided to assemble my first computer on my own, using my saved money and very little practical experience, since as a child I would take computers apart without ever being able to put them back together. In the end, my first assembled PC was the most powerful compared to those bought by my peers, and that’s where my passion for hardware was born.</p>

        <p>During the COVID period, stuck at home, I spent most of my time playing Fortnite as an eSports player with professional gamers while also exploring new programming languages. This allowed me to fill many gaps I had accumulated during the third year of high school.</p>

        <p>The fourth year was turbulent: I was initially held back because the teachers thought an extra year could help me. They were wrong. However, in the second attempt at the fourth year, with higher grades and consolidated knowledge, I managed to distinguish myself. The absence of my former teachers also helped. During the fifth year, even though the same teachers from the early years returned and tried to find excuses to lower my grades, I knew they did not define my value, and I could achieve passing grades with much less effort.</p>

        <p>After graduating from Rossi High School in Vicenza, I decided to enroll at the University of Verona, majoring in Computer Science, to show my former teachers who said I wasn’t cut out for university that they were wrong. Thanks to the skills I had already acquired in programming and mathematics, my university studies were much less demanding and much more rewarding.</p>

        <p>In the first two years of university, I studied and worked part-time as a computer assembler and waiter. My workstation grew alongside me, becoming more and more powerful and efficient in terms of quality/price, a criterion I have always used in my judgments and that allowed me to help others with their PCs. During the second year, I also started personal projects: websites, interactive games on Unity, and my first NAS for personal data.</p>

        <p>In the third year, I had the opportunity to go on Erasmus to Waterford, Ireland. Even though I was not very good at English, I seized this opportunity to broaden my horizons, improve my language skills, and engage with an international context.</p>

        <p>Today, my passion for technology has turned into concrete skills: I build custom PCs, develop websites, experiment with databases, and continue to deepen my programming knowledge. I believe in continuous learning, and I always seek new educational opportunities.</p>

        <p>Up to today, my career and interests continue to grow, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me.</p>
